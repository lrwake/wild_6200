Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

the epidemiological triad is a model that is used to help explain and understand the causes of disease. It consists of three parts that interact and help propagate the disease. The three parts include the environment, the agent, and the host of these disease. This model was developed to help explain the complexity and compounding factors of diseases.

Worksheet 2_3

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer: The sample size would be 59

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

sample size requirements for a large population at 95% confidence at 1% prevalence is 299

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

sample size requirements for a large population at 99% confidence at 2% prevalence is also 299

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, younare 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_less than\_\_\_\_ (\<, =,\>) \_\_1\_\_%.

4\) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations ofAlabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
Russell counties).

```{r}
russel <- read.csv("C:/Users/lrw0046/Downloads/DeerLameness_Russell.csv")
head(russel)
lee <- read.csv("C:/Users/lrw0046/Downloads/DeerLameness_Lee.csv")
head(lee)
chambers <- read.csv("C:/Users/lrw0046/Downloads/DeerLameness_Chambers.csv")
head(chambers)

```

\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.

CI set at 95%

Russel county prevalence- 3%

Lee county prevalence- 20%

Chambers county prevalence-27%

\
b) Compare prevalence using Fisher’s exact test

CI set at 95%

Russel county prevalence- 3.1%

Lee county prevalence- 20%

Chambers county prevalence-27%

5\) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish. She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:

\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected

Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish in the pond (including previously infected fish).

\
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.

day 1- .05, 5% cases per fish/day, day 2- .07, 7% cases per fish/day, day 5- .33, 33%cases per fish/day

\
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?

Day 3- 23%, Day 5 -75%

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?\
Day 1
