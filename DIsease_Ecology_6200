# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

# the epidemiological triad is a model that is used to help explain and understand the causes of disease. It consists of three parts that interact and help propogate the disease.
